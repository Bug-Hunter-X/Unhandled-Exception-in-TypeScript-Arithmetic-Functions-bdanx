This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: unhandled exceptions. The `bug.ts` file contains a set of arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The `divide` function throws an error if the divisor is zero, but the calling code doesn't handle this, leading to a program crash. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to handle this exception using a try-catch block.
